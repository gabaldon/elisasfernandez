More than half of parents with school-aged children (both in public and private schools) have to manage their children's field trips or expenses through external platforms outside the school, request time off from work to handle paperwork in person because there is no online option, or communicate with their children's tutor through their own school agendas because there are no other choices. School Pay was born out of this need.",
